This folder conatins the CSM3 CFD3 and FSI3 cases from Turek and Hron [1]. These cases represent a set of benchmarks outlined in the paper to verify and validate newly developed fluid structuer interaction applicaitons and methods. These three cases are outlined in the validation section of the OpenFPCI wiki.
